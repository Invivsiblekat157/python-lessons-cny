"programming is just giving really careful instructions"

Make sure to include .py file extension, otherwise you won't get syntax highlighting in the text editor (probably other problems, too, I don't know) [This is after first copy/paste into text editor in IDLE and try to run and it prompts you to save]

FYI, no word-wrap in current version of IDLE

previous thing I ran		alt+p
next thing I ran		alt+n

Start typing a variable name, press tab to autocomplete

Can enter logical statement things by themselves to test for TRUE/FALSE -- i.e., I can just run email.count("@") == 1 -- and the IDLE shell will reply, True or False (instead of having to do
if email.count("@") == 1:
	print "That is true."
else:
	print "That is false."
)

append takes EXACTLY one argument! (the error message told me so :) )

pop() defaults to chopping off the LAST list item

using enumerate() and zip() with "for"
	zip() goes like
		for (day, food) in zip(days_of_week, foods_of_day):
	enumerate() goes like
		for (index, day) in enumerate(days_of_week):
			print "Today is the {0}th day of the week, which is {1}".format(index, day)
			print "So day_of_week[{0}] is: {1}, which is the same as day, which is: {2}".format(index, days_of_week[index], day)

**while loops**
	>> Like an if statement, while asks "is this true?"
	>> FOR EXAMPLE
	if bread >= 2:
		print 'I'm making a sandwich.'
	-------------
	while bread >= 2:
		print 'I\'m making a sandwich.'
		bread = bread - 2

with .........
	A python keyword to create a "container" that will automagically close the file when you're done (sweet)

with open('filename.ext', 'x') .....
	x -- parameter to set the "mode" for opening the file.
	r: read-only mode
	w: write mode; also, if the file doesn't exist, Python will create a new file with that name
	a: append mode -- Python will append to the end of the existing file; also, if the file doesn't exist, Python will create a new file with that name
	b: binary mode -- for when reading from a non-text file, like an image

setting variables and printing
	(not from this class, just popped into my head and I wanted to make a note)
	we learned during an onboarding session that it does NOT work to set a variable and print it at the same time -- that is... the following does NOT work:
		print first_name = "Alison"

dictionary > key
	key is always a string

keys()
	dictionary method
	creates list of the keys of that dictionary, thru which you can iterate

values()
	dictionary method
	creates list of values from that dictionary, thru which you can iterate

items()
	dictionary method
	creates nested list of keys and values from that dictionary, thru which you can iterate

dictionary review...
	[me] really, dictionaries are just multi-dimentional arrays; makes me think of Drupal field collections... (or y'know, associative arrays in PHP)

functions
	You can include documentation about a function by adding a "help string" to very beginning of the function!!

set
	Like a list, but all values are unique
	Tip: You can easily remove duplicates from a list simply by converting it to a "set" -- i.e. my_list = list(set(my_list))

join
	Glue together the list with a separator between each list item.
	'\n'.join(my_list)

default arg/param values
	If your function has default arg/param values, these args/params must come last!

ordering function args/params
	If for some reason you want to provide your args/params out of order when using a function -- or lets say you're specifying values for some optional args but not others -- you can do so by explicitly defining values for each arg/param -- i.e.
		def happening(who, what, where='Washington, DC', when=todaysDateVar):
		[blah blah blah]
		happening('General public', '5k skip-walk', when=myDate)

[btw] True, False, None, and most other built-in constants in Python
	MUST capitalize first letter, or Python will think the word is a variable instead of the built-in constant!!

API (a very nice, clear definition)
	a live connection to a resource

example API query (that uses REST -- meaning you can access the API with a URL in this manner)
	http://bechdeltest.com/api/v1/getMovieByImdbId?imdbid=0367631
		getMovieByImdbId is the ENDPOINT
		imdbid=0367631 is a PARAMETER and its value

If you get "No JSON object could be decoded" error:
	check for typos! check your endpoint/params/etc.
