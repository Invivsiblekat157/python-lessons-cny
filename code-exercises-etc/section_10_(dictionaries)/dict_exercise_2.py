# How to add a new item to an existing dictionary:
contacts["Aliya Rahman"] = {
    "twitter": "@AliyaRahman",
    "github": "https://github.com/aliyarahman"
}

# Exercise 1: Add a new dictionary item to contacts for each person at your table.
#   Rather than editing lines 1-10 above, add new entries to the contacts dictionary below.
#   Keep in mind some people may not have a twitter account, and that's okay!

# Exercise 2: Loop through the contacts dictionary to display everyone's contact information.
#   Your output should look like this:

# Hear Me Code's info: 
#     twitter: @hearmecode
#     github: https://github.com/hearmecode
# Shannon Turner's info: 
#     twitter: @svt827
#     github: https://github.com/shannonturner
